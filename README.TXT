PROJECT TITLE:Lab 9
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Efficiency of PriorityQueue
VERSION or DATE:10/18/2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS:ChristianHOllar
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The two classes created were ArrayPriorityQueue and WeightedElement. 
ArrayPriorityQueue has three separate methods: add, peek, poll. Add added
 the input element into the instance of ArrayPriorityQueue. Peek found the 
 minimal element within the ArrayPriorityQueue instance. Poll did this 
 and removed the element. Unit Testing was tested using basic integers, 
 WeightedElements in the form of <Integer,Integer>, and WeightedElements 
 in the form of <String, String>. The ExperimentController class was also 
 installed to test the efficiency of peek and poll when the queue contained
 integers.  The first test method is testInt which tests the efficiency of 
 peek and poll for various amounts of integers within queue. The second test 
 method is testType which tests the efficiency of the add method for various 
 amounts of strings and integers.
